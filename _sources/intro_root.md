# About Me

### Academic Background
I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Engineering Science in Data Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, with an expected graduation in June 2026. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Sri Sairam Engineering College in Tamil Nadu, India.

My coursework has equipped me with strong analytical and computational skills in areas such as statistical learning, deep learning, data visualization, and natural language processing. These disciplines have provided me with a solid foundation to solve complex problems using innovative data-driven approaches.

### Professional Experience
After earning my bachelor's degree, I worked for over two years as an Engineer at Guardian India Operations Private Limited. During this time, I gained hands-on experience designing and implementing robust software solutions. Some highlights of my work include:
- Developing high-performance APIs with Java and Spring Boot, leading to a 30% improvement in system efficiency.
- Leading the migration from monolithic architectures to microservices, which enhanced modularity and deployment speed by 40%.
- Creating and maintaining over 20 microservices while implementing rigorous testing to ensure reliability and scalability.
- Collaborating in an agile, Scrum-based environment to streamline the development lifecycle and produce clear, comprehensive documentation.

### Technical Skills
- **Programming**: Java, Python, R, JavaScript, SQL
- **Tools and Frameworks**: Spring Boot, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Tableau, MySQL, AWS
- **Competencies**: API development, data visualization, machine learning, and agile methodologies

### Research and Publications
I have presented my research at national and international conferences, including a project on efficient stock prediction using machine learning. These experiences demonstrate my ability to bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

## Overview of My Project
The "Disease Prediction Model" is one of my most significant projects. Using machine learning techniques, I developed a system that predicts potential diseases based on patient data. This project reflects my passion for combining data science with healthcare, as it aims to provide timely insights that can improve patient care and outcomes. It exemplifies my ability to build innovative, practical solutions that address real-world challenges.
